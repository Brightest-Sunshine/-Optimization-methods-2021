# Optimization-methods-2021

  A cycle of 5 laboratory works on optimization methods in the third year of SPbSTU. 

1. Solving linear programming problems by the simplex method
2. Solution of transport problems by the method of the northwest corner and the method of potentials
3. Solving the problem of one-dimensional minimization using methods that do not use derivatives
4. Solving multidimensional optimization problems without constraints by methods of the first and second order
